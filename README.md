# EPCalloutView

EPCalloutView is a general-purpose callout/popover view for iOS. Originally created by my colleagues and me for [MIT](https://github.com/MIT-Mobile/MIT-Mobile-for-iOS) to replace MKMapView callouts and overcome some issues with SMCalloutView, this package is meant to be useful any time you need an easier or less-restricted callout/popover than the ones Apple provides.
